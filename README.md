# learn-go-with-tests
Repository used to store my code from Learn Go with Tests. I am using this to supplament mhy learning through the Ardan Labs course. I find it easier to pick this up because I can read instead of watching videos. I intend to further supplament Ardan Labs by writing tests as I begin to go through that course again in the near future.
